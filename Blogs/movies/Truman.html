<h1 class="name"><center>THE TRUMAN SHOW</center></h1>
<h2>-Peter Weir</h2>
<p class="para">This movie is unique in a way that makes you question the very nature of reality. It reminds you of those feelings which you had about the world when you were young, but as if the whole world convinced you into them being false. As if the world wanted you to go the other way, in a way where you have to be fake, a cheater, a people pleaser, a competitor, or someone who is always unsatisfied or unhappy because of life. That one even thinks of ending such a beautiful life in some instances. <br>
<br> 
 The movie shows that our lives are monotonous and some sort of script written by some higher authority. As if they get to decide what is important for us and what is not. As if they get to choose what we will feel and what we won't. Amidst all this, we are trying to figure out the meaning of life. We cannot conclude by thinking inside this loop. We have to think beyond what we know, what we feel, what we desire, that's how we might exit this loop. This feels like a paradox. How can we exit the loop by staying in the loop? <br>
 <br>
 It also reflects a fact that all our fears, our disbeliefs, our doubts, our problems are nothing but a lie told to us by the world. We aren't those timid beings that of which we have been convinced of. We can overcome those. We can be stronger than we know. More powerful than we look.<br>
 <br>
 We are nothing but the stardust. Our egos are fake, our cruelty is fake, our greediness is fake and the whole idea of privacy is fake.<br>
 <br>
 When we try to leave this fake world or walk into a more meaningful path we are obstructed by this unknown power which does not want us to leave. It will do everything in its power to make sure we stay inside our limitations. So that we don't realize our true potential. That's where we have to act smart that's where we have to show courage to fight all the setbacks and emerge as a stronger being. <br>
 <br>
 With constant perseverance and hard work, just like that, the whole fraudulent pretentious world will fall apart and you will be faced with the true reality of the unknown. Right before setting your first foot into this world, a sound of the unknown will ask you to return to what is comfortable and easy. This will be the voice of what we call 'GOD'. Just like the wise words of Truman we too must say<mark>"Good Morning.. Oh In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening and goodnight."</mark></p>
